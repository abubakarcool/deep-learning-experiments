# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of **deep learning projects**, ranging from beginner-friendly implementations to more advanced experiments with real-world datasets.

It covers a variety of models and concepts like:

- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU)
- Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Transfer Learning
- NLP using deep learning
- Custom dataset preprocessing
- Sentiment analysis, classification, generation, etc.
